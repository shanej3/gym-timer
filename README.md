## Gym timer
- Simple app to learn the basics of React Native
- The main inspiration for this app was wanting a better stopwatch - since I like to use the default stopwatch app on my phone to make sure I rest enough between sets at the gym, and to track how long I've been there
### Main functions
#### Rest timer 

- By default the Rest button starts a stopwatch, but this can also be changed into a timer (+/- buttons)
- When you finish a set, click the rest button which will start the timer and increment which set you are currently on
- Click the reset button when you move on to your next exercise 
- Total workout time is also tracked
#### Calendar (Track your workouts)
- WIP calendar function keeps track of what days you worked out and what type of workout it was
- When you're finished with your workout, click STOP and you will be prompted to track your workout, and provide a brief summary of the workout (leg day, upperbody, etc.)

#### Tools used
- Languages: Javascript/Typescript
- React Native / Expo
- Wix calendar library
